# Code Refactor Starter Code

# <Creating Accesibility for Horiseon Solutions>

## Description

The motivation behind this project was to edit the pre existing code of this site to comply with accesibility standards through the use of features such as alt readers so that this marketing agencys website can be optimized for higher functionality on the web. Through this process I learned the importance of clean code structure, use of semantic elements in HTML and more importanly, how to restructure a pre existing code base to ensure optimal performance within highly rated search engines.

üèÜ The previous sections are the bare minimum, and your project will ultimately determine the content of this document. You might also want to consider adding the following sections.

## Badges

Badges aren't necessary, per se, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## Features

Features of this page include a nav bar with links that send you to their corresponding information within the web page.

## How to Contribute

Open to collaboration, if you choose to do so open an issue and modify any changes you would like to see on a feature branch and wait for approval before merging to the main branch. 

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
